# Frontend Mentor "Quiz App" challenge solution

Hey Hi üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è !

I'm **Renaud** and this is my solution to the [Frontend "**Quiz App**" challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/frontend-quiz-app-BE7xkzXQnU).

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges help developers improve their programming skills by building realistic projects; the "Quiz App" project is one of those.

The original requirements for this app (beside trying to adhere to the given visual design) were :

_Your users should be able to:_

- _Select a quiz subject_
- _Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four_
- _See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection_
- _See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer_
- _Move on to the next question after seeing the question result_
- _See a completed state with the score after the final question_
- _Play again to choose another subject_
- _View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size_
- _See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page_
- _Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard_
- _**Bonus:** Change the app's theme between light and dark_

Most of these requirements have been met except the keyboard navigation which probably needs more work.
The accessibility also requires additional work.
Overall, I'm happy with this first version even though it can definitely be improved upon.

The solution I implemented is available [here](https://rlapoele.github.io/fm-quiz-app/).

I've implemented this using [#vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [#solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [#tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I was already familiar with vite and tailwindcss but not so much with solidjs; this has therefore been a really nice opportunity for me to learn more about some of solid's features.

I really liked using solidjs and I found it much simpler (and better I think) to use than react or even vue.

Hope you like it!
